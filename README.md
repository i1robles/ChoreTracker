# ChoreTracker - Prototype

Are you a parent struggling to organize the chores around your house? Do you have roommates who claim to do their share, but don't? Do you want an easy way to make sure your household is being taken care of? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need ChoreTracker. ChoreTracker is a web app that lets you easily connect small sensors to your account that track the completion of your house's chores. Don't want the tiny sensors? You can still use the app to organize, assign, and reward the completion of chores!

## How It Works

Users go to the ChoreTracker website and create an account (or log in). Next they can add Child Users to their own accounts, which would only be able to mark chores completed. The Parent Users, however, can assign recurring chores to different kids, assign different points to the chores, and mark them completed. If users choose to purchase a sensor pack, they can easily connect the sensors to their home wifi and attach them to a few places around the house. Then they can check their account and get live updates on the chores, such as the trash being 50% full.

## Sensor-Verified Chores

At the moment, ChoreTracker allows the user to connect 3 different types of sensors to track and verify the completion of chores. All other chores can still be assigned, organized, and completed like normal, they simply don't have an accompanying sensor.

**Trash**, users can tell exactly what percentage full their trash cans are at any moment.

**Dishes** users can get a small image at the push of a button to see the current status of their sinks.

**Bed**, users can see if the bed has been made by checking if small sensors on the bed align with the comforters/blankets.
